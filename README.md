Enhancing Supermarket Operations with Text Analytics" aims to improve supermarket operations using text analytics to understand customer behaviors, preferences, and visitation patterns, thereby optimizing operations and efficiency.

The project utilizes datasets containing check-in information, reviews, and business details to gain insights into customer visit frequencies and business characteristics. Techniques like sentiment analysis and topic modeling with BERT are employed to process and analyze text data, focusing on extracting meaningful patterns from customer feedback and check-ins.

Key findings include:

- Positive and negative sentiment trends towards supermarkets, with specific attention to Trader Joe's for its positive shopping experience, customer service, product quality, and pricing, especially in wine and cheese selections.
- Walmart's need for improvement in employee engagement, security measures, and customer experience management to address negative aspects highlighted by topic modeling.
- Temporal analysis of check-ins revealing seasonal and yearly trends, with sentiment analysis indicating the impact of events and seasonal offerings on customer sentiment.

The presentation also discusses competitors such as Walmart Supercenter, AJ's Fine Foods, Safeway, Whole Foods Market, Costco, Target, Trader Joeâ€™s, and Fry's Food & Drug Stores, aiming to compare supermarkets based on star ratings and sentiments.

In conclusion, the team suggests that text analytics can reveal important trends and preferences, guiding supermarkets to enhance their operations and customer satisfaction.
